/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the TON Gift Marketplace.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has a dedicated
 * data tree under `/users/{userId}`, and only the authenticated user can access
 * their own data. NFT gifts are stored within user-specific subcollections,
 * providing authorization independence.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user account information.
 * - /users/{userId}/nft_gifts/{giftId}: Stores NFT gifts owned by a user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data (ownership enforced via path-based rules).
 * - Listing other users' data is disallowed to prevent information leakage.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `ownerId` field in `NftGift` is unnecessary because ownership is already
 *   established by the path `/users/{userId}/nft_gifts/{giftId}`. The `ownerId`
 *   field can be used for data integrity.
